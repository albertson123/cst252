		<h1>Lab 12: Loops</h1>
			<p>In this lab we made a website that has a loop that shows different value prints for numbers 1-200 that are multiples of 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 105.</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>This lab wasn't too bad since we did a shorter version of it in class; the largest challenge was articulating where to put the new inner HTML and how.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>An html index with a loop that shows different value prints for numbers 1-200 that are multiples of 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 105. </p>

		<p>This is the next step we coded; its written out in Atom.</p>
