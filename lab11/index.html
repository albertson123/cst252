		<h1>Lab 11: Conditionals</h1>
			<p></p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>I legit do not know why this javascript coding isn't showing, but I know it's because of some tiny typo that I made. So I did the best I could with this one but it was indeed challenging.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>An html index, with a conditional array of choices of which personality you truly are. (The houses are Soft, Chaotic, Feral, and Cursed.) </p>

		<p>This is the the Javascript I did in Atom.</p>
