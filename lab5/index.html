		<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<p>In this lab we got a first look into what javascript can do by making different attributes of a car including its type, model, color, year, and age. It responded in an interactive way that now processed the new rules we made and automatically gave us the values that we entered in. We decided to go with a Sage Green 1967 Volkswagon Bus.</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>This lab was actually pretty difficult at first because me partner and I have never even used Javascript and we were a bit confused by the instructions. The every task we ended up choosing was "to create a shopping list."  </p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Here are the lists that we came up with, along with screenshots and captions for what we did.</p>

		<p>Below is the first task we psuedocoded. This outline was to create a shopping list, which we tried to make as basic as possible.</p>

		<p>This is the next task we psuedocoded. For this outline we wanted to make a computer generate a random cat image every time we refreshed the page. Although this is something we don't know how to yet, we figured that it is something we will learn during this semester.</p>
