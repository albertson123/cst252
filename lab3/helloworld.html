	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	<h2>Lab 3 File Structure</h2>
		<p> My name is Caden Albertson. This is our lab where we practice making sure our file structure is successful and uploading our HTML index that's associated with it. Thankfully because of ATOM and Github, many of the files are already organized and online for us. For some context as to when this was made, California was set on fire because it was a boy two says ago. This image below is a representation of my last brain cell trying to keep it together.</p>
	<h3>Challenges</h3>
		<p>It was really challenging remembering that githib uploaded websites and made them public automatically, since github and atom are really new to me. I looked for a "publish" button when everything was already uploaded.</p>
	<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>An html based website that showcases screenshots of the file structure and html that created this lab.</p>
