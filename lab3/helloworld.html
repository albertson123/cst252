	<p> My name is Caden Albertson. This is our lab where we practice making sure our file structure is successful and uploading our HTML index that's associated with it. Thankfully because of ATOM and Github, many of the files are already organized and online for us. For some context as to when this was made, California was set on fire because it was a boy two says ago. This image below is a representation of my last brain cell trying to keep it together.</p>
