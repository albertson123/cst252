		<h2>Script Output</h2>
		<script src="js/lab.js"></script>
		</div>

			<p>We are making DOM elements and variables and editing those elements and varibles with new js commands.</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>I'm a bit ill at the moment so it's a little challenging to stay focused and alert while working on this. Figuring out what to do for a little bit was also a challenge but my brain started to slowly start speaking javascript language.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>An index with new commands in javascript including new DOM elements, assigning those elements to variables, and editing the HTML in those variables using javascript.</p>

		<p>Below is the first javascript task I coded in the console in the inspect tab. </p>

		<p>This is the next step we coded, its the same coding as in the console, but its written out in Atom.</p>
