	<h1>Stuff About Myself</h1>
		<p>Hello! My name is Caden Albertson, I am 20 years old and I am a student at CSUMB and this is my 3rd year. I am a Communication Design major with a concentration on visual design. Web design has always felt less intuitive for me which makes me want to get proficient at it that much more! </p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
	<p>I really love to digitally draw and sketch, first and foremost. I used to sketch the human figure a lot but lately I've been exploring different areas creativity like plants, visualizing spiritualitual concepts, and creating hybrid creatures. I also really enjoy making silicon molds and hope to start a silicon keychain series involving marine wildlife really soon! Additionally, thanks to quarantine, I found out that I really enjoy sewing buttons to different accessories/pieces of clothing I have to help give them more character/color. I also really enjoy partaking in intellectual discussions and learning new perspectives from people. Looking after my family is important to me, both humans and animals. We own three cats, 2 rabbits, a corn snake, a miniature ball python, a baby sand boa, a bearded dragon, and a blind, but very happy, kayuga duck. It is super fun to interact with all of these animals, and I will definitely reflect that love as I go out and live life on my own. </p>
	<h3>Accomplishments</h3>
