		<h1>Lab 20: JSON and APIs (XKCD comic!)</h1>
			<p></p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>There were a few issues getting the comic to show, and also there is a lag on my google chrome that is not too bad but still annoying to deal with when I'm trying to figure out why my code may not be working.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>A mix of API and JSON and using an API to get a comic out using javascript.</p>

			<p>This what I coded in Atom.</p>

			<h2>Script Output</h2>
			<p>You see this grid? It's pretty sweet right? Also, you see that sticky nav bar? It's sicker than Tony Hawk right?</p>
