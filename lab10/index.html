		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>For a little while I was not sure where to start with this lab, cause I wasn't sure what/how to attach anything to my sort() work from Lab 7. Thanks to Val and their keen sense of memory, we were able to find Wes's fiddle and base our js coding off of their example, or cake recipe.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>An index that has a js implimented title, a bar starting with "My name is" and then you can type in your name, and a button that says "press me". </p>

		<p>This is the next step I coded in javascript</p>
